/**
 *  The Game class implements the main game methods and manages the game state.
 *  It handles player actions, processes commands, and interacts with different parts of the game world.
 *  Responsibilities:
 *  - Initialize game state and objects.
 *  - Process player commands and execute corresponding actions.
 *  - Manage game progression and state changes.
 *  - Handle interactions between game elements (rooms, items, player).
 *  - Control the game flow and loop until the game is finished.
 *
 *  This class is the heart of a simple text-based game.
